# Accepted.txt

This file contains the grades of the P2 students 2011

Please check your grades every week and inform us as soon as possible if 
something is not correct. For admission to the exam 8 out of 10 exercises 
need to be ok. Note that problemset 08 is mandatory for problemset 09.
This means: without problemset 08 problemset 09 can't be completed and won't be graded too.
