<h2 id='coding_rules'>Coding rules</h2>

<ol>
<li>Write postconditions to assure that your public methods work right (that way, you will find bugs faster).</li>

<li>Avoid using and changing variables at the same time. (especially if you&#8217;re not sure about the functionality).</li>

<li>Consider that for-loops only stop AFTER the condition breaks. (Check that the values are what you need after the LAST loop).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='rules_for_tests'>Rules for tests</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use the expected statement after @Test if you expect an Error</li>

<li>Be sure that you know what the expected value is, if you test it. (Otherwise you get failing tests, even though your programm works fine).</li>

<li>Use the @Given statement so you don&#8217;t have to setup a new scenario for each test.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='readability_and_maintainability'>Readability and maintainability</h2>

<ol>
<li>Write some javadoc, so one can see what a method should do (what it&#8217;s responsible for).</li>

<li>Write an invariant for your postconditions.</li>
</ol>
