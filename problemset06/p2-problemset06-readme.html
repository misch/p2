<p>The head of ACME Software Inc. assigns you as consultant to a new team. Your new team is known to despise best practices and to deliver code that smells. Naturally, they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of bugs in their code!</p>

<p>As your first job, you&#8217;re to help them find bugs in their linked list implementation. You are supposed to teach them how to use a debugger as you go along, and then put some best practices and coding convention in place.</p>

<p>You should teach your team to</p>

<ol>
<li>Formulate a hypothesis about what went wrong.</li>

<li>Verify your hypothesis using the debugger.</li>

<li>Use Occam&#8217;s razor to determine the simplest explanation for the behavior you observe.</li>

<li>If the bug is not yet found, continue at #1.</li>

<li>Explain the bug.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='1_pull_problemset06_into_your_repository'>(1) Pull problemset06 into your repository.</h2>

<pre><code>	git pull p2ubungen master</code></pre>

<h2 id='2_go_bug_hunting_and_provide_your_hypotheses'>(2) Go bug hunting and provide your hypotheses.</h2>

<p>You will notice that out of the 11 test methods, only 4 pass. At least your new team is writing tests! Choose one of the tests, and then follow the steps above to explain the bug. Then, add a section into <code>hypotheses.mdown</code> that states your hypothesis, the result of your verification of that hypothesis with a screen shot that lets us confirm your reasoning, and your explanation of what you observed.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to make a section for each hypothesis that you iterate through, but make sure to have a few interesting ones in the file.</p>

<p>Please be sure to write <a href='http://media.libsyn.com/media/howtube/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.pdf'>valid Markdown</a> in the <code>hypotheses.md</code> file.</p>

<h2 id='4_formulate_best_practices_and_coding_conventions_for_your_team'>(4) Formulate best practices and coding conventions for your team.</h2>

<p>Please provide us with at least two coding rules that help to prevent the bugs that you&#8217;ve observed! Also, please provide at least one rule for writing better tests, as well as a rule for writing more maintainable and more readable code. More rules are pluses. Put the rules into a file called <code>coding-conventions.mdown</code>.</p>

<h2 id='5_hand_in_the_solution'>(5) Hand in the solution</h2>

<p>Then, push your solution to pinocchio.</p>
