<p>Your boss at ACME Inc. is more than pleased with your Ursuppe game. However, he noticed that whenever he asks you to do a number of things, it&#8217;s cumbersome for him to remember what exactly it is he asked, when checking your solution. So he asks you to write a to do application. Since it&#8217;s just for you and him, there aren&#8217;t any users, no login, nothing, just a website with todos, and a button to add new ones. He asks you to do it in Seaside for Pharo, because he read at the hairdressers that the cool kids from today have had a look at Seaside.</p>

<p>From the hairdresser&#8217;s, he clipped out the following set of instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run Seaside.app, a window appears.</li>

<li>Open <a href='http://localhost:8080'>http://localhost:8080</a> in your web browser.</li>

<li>In the web browser, you&#8217;re offered to create a new component. nter &#8220;Todo&#8221; as a component name, and click create.</li>

<li>You&#8217;re now queried for your first name and last name. Enter them in the web browser.</li>

<li>Now your component should be active under <a href='http://localhost:8080/Todo'>http://localhost:8080/Todo</a>.</li>

<li>Go back to the Seaside Window.</li>

<li>In the system browser window inside the Seaside window, scroll down to the category &#8220;Seaside-User-Examples in the left-most pane.&#8221;</li>

<li>Find the class &#8220;Todo&#8221; there.</li>

<li>Click it and look at the renderContentOn: method.</li>

<li>Start from that method. Modify it, add more classes, and create a todo list application</li>

<li>To save your work, in the Seaside window, click &#8220;Save and quit&#8221; in the menu that comes up when you click on empty space. When re-opening Seaside, you&#8217;ll be exactly where you left off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your todo list application should at least allow viewing all tasks, and adding new tasks.</p>
